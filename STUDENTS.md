# Guide for students working with me

You are a student or intern working with me for a limited-time project?
Keep reading, this is important. 


## What I expect from you

* **Commitment**: I expect an interest and attachment for the project
  you're working on, and dedication to deliver quality results. It's
  more important for you than for me, since this project will in part
  determine the rest of your career/life. More generally, you should be
  in love with the field you've chosen to work in and put all your
  energy into it. If you're not excited about working on this project
  every morning or if you look forward the end of the day to go have
  "fun" elsewhere, then something's wrong.

* **Rigor**: I expect intellectual rigor and an analytical mindset. If
  you're trying to solve a problem

For
  example, if you make a claim you should be able to tell the premises
upon that claim stands.

* **Organization**: 

* **Focus**: no multi-task / distraction, facebook in the background

* **Independence**: We're all grown ups

* **Initiative**: bring your own ideas, challenge mine


## What you can expect from me

* **Support**: answer questions (see below)

* **Flexibility**: adapt topic to something that would be better for you
  (in terms of learning, efficiency, or career); work from home

* **Honesty**: 

Some more specific points:

## Communications

Slack convenient

Code: we'll use git, so make sure you're familiar with git before
starting. Follow best practices.

## Questions

Google, SO; you should know how to search.  I you ask me a question and
in 10s I find the answer on Google's first page, then I'll feel like
you're wasting my time.


## Working hours

I don't care about when you work nor about the number of hours you spent
in front of your computer, I just care about your motivation and
results.

You may receive emails from me at night or during week-ends, but that
does not mean that I want you to also work at those times.
